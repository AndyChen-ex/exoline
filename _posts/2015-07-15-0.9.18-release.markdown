Here's a roundup of features that have been added to Exoline over the past few months. Special thanks to [Andrew Solz](https://github.com/asolz) and [Mike Tilstra](https://github.com/tadpol) for working on many of these features.

- support for [tab completion](https://github.com/exosite/exoline#tab-completion)

- `spec` command supports [non-script datarules](https://github.com/exosite/exoline/blob/master/test/files/spec_datarule.yaml), [dispatches](https://github.com/exosite/exoline/blob/master/test/files/spec_dispatch.yaml), [client limits](https://github.com/exosite/exoline/blob/master/test/files/spec_client_limits.yaml), [loading from a URL](https://github.com/exosite/exoline#tab-completion), and [embedding Lua scripts](https://github.com/exosite/exoline/blob/master/test/files/spec_script_embedded.yaml)
- better support for [working on multiple Portals domains](https://github.com/exosite/exoline#multiple-projects)
- `dump` command for archiving catalog and time series data
- `script --follow` option (for script debugging)
- `find` command for selecting a subset of resources, currently just inside a direct parent
- `search` command for locating resource that match a query, including full text of script content


**Note**: Due to a dependency conflict if you installed 0.9.17 yesterday, you'll need to do this to make 0.9.18 work:


```
$ pip uninstall python-dotenv
```
