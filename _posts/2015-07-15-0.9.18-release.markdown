Here's a roundup of features that have been added to Exoline over the past few months:

- support for [tab completion](https://github.com/exosite/exoline#tab-completion) - thanks [Andrew Solz](https://github.com/asolz)!
- spec command supports [non-script datarules](https://github.com/exosite/exoline/blob/master/test/files/spec_datarule.yaml), [dispatches](https://github.com/exosite/exoline/blob/master/test/files/spec_dispatch.yaml), [client limits](https://github.com/exosite/exoline/blob/master/test/files/spec_client_limits.yaml), [loading from a URL](https://github.com/exosite/exoline#tab-completion), and [embedding Lua scripts](https://github.com/exosite/exoline/blob/master/test/files/spec_script_embedded.yaml)
- better support for [working on multiple Portals domains](https://github.com/exosite/exoline#multiple-projects) - thanks [Mike Tilstra](https://github.com/tadpol)!
- dump command for archiving catalog and time series data
- script --follow option (for script development)
- find command for finding resources, currently just inside a direct parent
- search command for searching resources, including script content


Note: Due to a dependency conflict if you installed 0.9.17 yesterday, you'll need to do this to make 0.9.18 work:


```
$ pip uninstall python-dotenv
```
